        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>For this project, we worked in a group of 4 to brainstorm, design, and construct an interactive prototype for Warp, a terminal reimagined with AI and collaborative tools for better productivity. This project was divided into 7 distinct phases:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Identifying and understanding the problem at hand</li>
            <li>Sketching preliminary ideas individually about a potential solution</li>
            <li>Finalizing a low-fidelity wireframe</li>
            <li>Participating in a peer critique and revising the prototype based on feedback received</li>
            <li>Creating and refining a style guide</li>
            <li>Developing a final, clickable, high-fidelity prototype</li>
            <li>Presenting the final prototype to the client and receiving feedback</li>
        </ol>
        <hr class="horizontal-line">
        <h1>Part 1: Understanding and Clarifying the Problem</h1>
        <p>For this project, the main problem that we needed to address was that in Warp today, there is no place in the product to connect with other users, share tools, or install extensions. The two main target groups that are affected by this problem
            are the <b>creator</b>, who falls under the persona of an experienced developer that enjoys making and sharing tools for others to use, and the <b>consumer</b>, who is looking for a tool to help get a particular task done. Our hope is to introduce
            several features that allow users to find tools without having to leave the interface as well as grow their career/personal brands and learn more about particular tools or methodologies.</p>

        <hr class="horizontal-line">
        <h1>Part 2: Sketching</h1>
        <p>In this phase, each member of our group created 2 different end-to-end flows for solving our startup's problem.</p>

        <h1>Part 3: First Iteration (Low-Fidelity) Wireframing</h1>
        <p>The main design decisions that led to this final design included maximizing whitespace efficiently, 
            while keeping the terminal visible since the main users are engineers who 
            tend to prefer having multiple components open (Drive, AI, etc). In addition, to these 
        another big focus was on ensuring visual hierarchy since each component had limited space due 
        to the terminal needing to stay in view. So, while having lots of information visible, we needed 
        to ensure the user still found the component organized and thus easy to navigate.
        </p>

        <p>For the low-fidelity wireframing phase, our group convened to discuss which parts of the sketches best address different needs of the client. We eventually came to an agreement on 3 main features: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>A new community page</li>
            <li>Enhanced user profiles</li>
            <li>Ability to publish a tool from the existing Warp Drive</li>
        </ul>


        <p>
            In the process of creating these low-fidelity wireframes, 
            we utilized several components from different sketches.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                For the community feature, we incorporated:
                <ul>
                    <li>Sketch 1, flow 1's horizontal community layout because enabling the user 
                        to see the search results from community while Warp AI was simultaneously open,
                        increased usability
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                For the profile feautre, we incporated:
                <ul>
                    <li>Sketch 2, flow 1's profile content, such as bio, followers/following, and 
                        published tools because this encourages the user to explore/post on community 
                        while connecting the 2 features
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                For the publish tool feature, we incorporated:
                <ul>
                    <li>Sketch 3, flow 2's origin point from Warp drive because it's 
                        intuitive for the user to publish from the same place once they 
                        create their tool (effectively starting and finishing the end-to-end-flow of tool creation to publication 
                        in the same location in Warp)
                    </li>
                    <li>Sketch 3, flow 1's publish modal layout because we wanted 
                        the user to be able to see the contents of their Warp drive as they 
                        publish a tool</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        

        <p>We felt that these 3 main features led to our intended impact of allowing 
            users to connect with other users, share their created tools to the community, 
            and install tools from others in the community. 
            Specifically, the new community page and ability to publish a tool from Warp Drive 
            enables the sharing and downloading of tools within Warp community - useful to both 
            creators and consumers. 
            Then, the enhanced user profile allows users to follow other users, building their 
            connections within Warp. 
            In total, these 3 components accomplish the usability features we intended to create through 
            this design.

        <p>Below, we have displayed the low-fidelity wireframes for each of these 3 main flows:</p>

        <h3>Community Page Flow</h3>

        <h1>Part 4: Studio Critique and Mid-Project Check In</h1>
        <h2>Client Feedback</h2>
        <p>After presenting our low-fidelity wireframes to the client and receiving 
            feedback from both them and our classmates in studio, 
            we decided to make the following changes to our wireframes.
             Firstly, we wanted to incorporate the same profile view
            that is visible from opening Warp Drive into the community page. 
            Another piece of feedback that we received was to add options for a 
            user to install, uninstall, and rate a tool.
            Lastly, the client preferred a side-by-side vertical
            view for the community page. </p>

        <h2>Peer Feedback</h2>
        <p>From studio, after hearing
            that it would be difficult for users to generate their own tags when publishing tools,
            we changed the publish modal to include some auto-generated tags.
            On the other hand, some suggestions from the critique session that we decided not to 
            incorporate into our revised wireframes were including a feature to 
            search for particular users. 
            We believe that the Warp Community page should primarily be focused on the tools
            that users create rather than the actual users themselves. Furthermore, users would be able 
            to search through their following/followers list for users, encouraging users to build their 
            connections on Warp.
            Additionally, there were some suggestions about removing the profile section of the interface, 
            as it may discourage new users from trying the app. 
            However, ultimately, we decided that
            a profile page would be something that is already familiar to a large percentage of users 
            and it is a clean way to aggregate a list of tools for the user and others to view.</p>

        <hr class="horizontal-line">
        <h1>Part 5: Updating Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h1>
        <p>The main updates we made included were moving from a horizontal community view to a vertical view 
            because we decided it was important to stay consistent with Warp's current layout and avoid any user confusion.
            Additionally, we added a download button for the user to rate/install tools because it is important for users 
            to interact with the tools in community for usability purposes.  Lastly, in community we incorporated 
            auto-generated tags to filter tools to make it easier for users to find what they are looking for, since tools 
            can span many categories and are very broad. 
        </p>
        <p>After implementing the changes from the previous phase, our refined low-fidelity wireframes looked like the following:</p>

        <h3>Refined Community Page Flow</h3>
        <div class="refined-lofi-community-container">
            <img src="assets/second_lofi_community.png" alt="refined wireframes for the community page flow">

            <img src="assets/second_lofi_profile.png" alt="refined wireframes for the profile page flow">

        <h3>Refined Publishing Flow</h3>

        <hr class="horizontal-line">
        <h1>Part 6: High-Fidelity Prototyping</h1>
        <p>After updating our low-fidelity wireframes, we were ready to move onto creating the high-fidelity prototypes. However, before doing so, we created a visual design style guide inspired by the rough style guide/brand kit provided by Warp. This allowed
            our group to understand the visual language intended by the client as well as create coherent designs.</p>
        <h2>Visual Design Style Guide:</h2>
        <div class="style-guide-container">
            <img src="assets/design_guide.png" alt="visual design style guide">
        </div>
        <h2>Decisions for Style Guide</h2>
        <p>When creating the style guide, we wanted to maintain as much uniformity 
            with the existing brand manual kit provided to us by Warp. 
            For that reason, the color of the dropdown menu and filter options use the 
            same green in their style guide. The
            primary colors used by them in their terminal are black and white, 
            so we decided to keep our primary colors the same. 
            We believe that Warp decide to use these colors so that users can more easily
            read text quickly and accurately. 
            Also, developers could be using the Warp terminal for long periods of time, 
            and having natural colors such as black and white could 
            ease eye strain as opposed to more vibrant colors. </p>

        <p>Additionally, when creating all the icons needed for our hifi prototypes, 
            we made sure to use the same icons that were already present in their interface. 
            We believe that their icon choice follows most online platforms, 
            with icons such as the
            gear and magnifying glass representing settings and search respectively, for example. 
            Some suggestions for improving the Warp style guide could be to include more 
            details/guidelines about spacing in certain pages as well as displaying more
            combinations of text on certain color backgrounds to examine how we should 
            maximize contrast for certain features.</p>
        <p>We also want to note that while some text on the green background is low 
            contrast (from WCAG AA guidelines for accessibility), we wanted to stay consistent 
        with the existing visual style guide.</p>

        <h2>High-Fidelity Prototypes and Design Choices</h2>
        <p>We've divided our design choices into 3 sections, one for each major flow we designed as part of our solution:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Community Page: </b></li>
            <p>For the community page, we wanted to first ensure clear navigation to the page without making any significant changes to the homepage. To do this, we added a globe icon in the top right to signal to users that this is the place where they
                can interact with other Warp users and share tools. Upon opening the community page, we wanted to make this page as similar as possible to other popular community pages (using the design principle of familiar layouts), such as in Figma.
                Users can see a list of tools that have been published from the users that they follow as well as explore tools in general. They also have the ability to search for specific tools that they need via a search bar and filter down categories
                of tools that they would like. This supports the idea of content discovery and increases user engagement.</p>
            <li><b>Profile Flow: </b></li>
            <p>For the profile flow, the main information that we wanted to convey include the number of total tool downloads, number of total likes on tools, as well as the number of users that this person is following and how many users are following this
                user. We wanted to make the profile similar to many other social networks, such as Instagram or Facebook for ease of user. We also felt like the idea of a profile card with the option to edit the profile is something that is already familiar
                to many users. We also wanted to make the user's own published tools to be visible on their profile and give them the ability to sort and filter just like in the community page. The reason why we wanted to include this profile page on
                the left was because Warp's Personal tab is already located on this side so we wanted to make all personal elements on the same side of the interface.</p>
            <li><b>Publishing Flow: </b></li>
            <p>Lastly, for the publishing flow, we wanted to utilize the same design principles as before and create an additional option for the user to engage with their tool without creating a completely new flow from scratch. We added a "Publish" option
                to the existing dropdown menu for each tool, which opened a new modal for the user to edit and eventually publish. Throughout this flow, we used the same colors and modal design as in previous modals in Warp for creating a tool and we
                added a confirmation page at the end of the process so that the user receives immediate feedback and aassurance about their action. </p>
        </ul>
        <p>The link to our Figma file containing our high-fidelity prototypes is provided here: <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/RkZZCZZ8VvhttbmdmLYRHH/Iterative-Design-Flows?type=design&node-id=77-1420&mode=design&t=NZUUs7NofbOz0hUU-0">High-Fidelity Prototypes</a></p>

        <hr class="horizontal-line">
        <h1>Part 7: Final Founder Feedback and Conclusion:</h1>
        <p>At the very end, we met with the client from Warp to share our progress and display our final prototypes. Overall, we received positive feedback but there were a few items of feedback that we aim to implement in our refined designs:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><b>Inconsistency of Space: </b> There is some inconsistency in regards to spacing for items in the community tab. Some tags have too much surrounding whitespace and the widgets containing each tool could be made more compact</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Integration of Profile into Community: </b> Another piece of feedback that we received is about the possibility of moving the profile page into the community tab. Since the community tab is a secondary experience and not the main focus
                    of Warp, this could create a more centralized user experience and streamlined user flow.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>In the end, we presented our final high-fidelity prototypes to our designer and received positive feedback. It was a great experience to engage with the full iterative design process with a unique company that presented an interesting challenge
            for us. This project also gave us a good opportunity to practice building collaborative designs with a team that mirror cross-functional teams in industry.</p>
