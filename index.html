        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>For this project, we worked in a group of 4 to brainstorm, design, and construct an interactive prototype for Warp, a terminal reimagined with Ai and collaborative tools for better productivity. This project was divided into 7 distinct phases:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Identifying and understanding the problem at hand</li>
            <li>Sketching preliminary ideas individually about a potential solution</li>
            <li>Finalizing a low-fidelity wireframe</li>
            <li>Participating in a peer critique and revising the prototype based on feedback received</li>
            <li>Creating and refining a style guide</li>
            <li>Developing a final, clickable, high-fidelity prototype</li>
            <li>Presenting the final prototype to the client and receiving feedback</li>
        </ol>
        <hr class="horizontal-line">
        <h1>Part 1: Understanding and Clarifying the Problem</h1>
        <p>For this project, the main problem that we needed to address was that in Warp today, there is no place in the product to connect with other users, share tools, or install extensions. The two main target groups that are affected by this problem
            are the <b>creator</b>, who falls under the persona of an experienced developer that enjoys making and sharing tools for others to use, and the <b>consumer</b>, who is looking for a tool to help get a particular task done. Our hope is to introduce
            several features that allow users to find tools without having to leave the interface as well as grow their career/personal brands and learn more about particular tools or methodologies.</p>

        <hr class="horizontal-line">
        <h1>Part 2: Sketching</h1>
        <p>In this phase, each member of our group created 2 different end-to-end flows for solving our startup's problem.</p>

        <hr class="horizontal-line">
        <h1>Part 3: First Iteration (Low-Fidelity) Wireframing</h1>
        <p>For the low-fidelity wireframing phase, our group convened to discuss which parts of the sketches best address different needs of the client. We eventually came to an agreement on 3 main features: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>A new community page</li>
            <li>Enhanced user profiles</li>
            <li>Ability to publish a tool from the existing Warp Drive</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Below, we have displayed the low-fidelity wireframes for each of these 3 main flows:</p>

        <h3>Community Page Flow</h3>

            <img src="assets/lofi_community.png" alt="initial wireframes for the community page flow">

        <h3>Profile Page Flow</h3>
        <div class="lofi-profile-container">

        <h3>Publishing a Tool Flow</h3>

        <hr class="horizontal-line">
        <h1>Part 4: Studio Critique and Mid-Project Check In</h1>
        <p>After presenting our low-fidelity wireframes to the client and receiving feedback from both them and our classmates in studio, we decide to make the following changes to our wireframes. Firstly, we wanted to incorporate the same profile view that
            is visible from opening Warp Drive into the community page. Another piece of feedback that we received was to add options for a user to install, uninstall, and rate a tool. Lastly, the client provided shared that a side-by-side vertical view
            for the community page would be more intuitive and user-friendly. </p>

        <br>
        <p>Some suggestions from the critique session that we decided not to incorporate into our revised wireframes were including a feature to search for particular users. We believe that the Warp Community page should primarily be focused on the tools
            that users create rather than the actual users themselves. Additionally, there were some suggestions about removing the profile section of the interface, as it may discourage new users from trying the app. However, ultimately, we decided that
            a profile page would be something that is already familiar to a large percentage of users and it is a clean way to aggregate a list of tools for the user and others to view.</p>

        <h1>Part 5: Updating Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h1>
        <p>After implementing the change from the previous phase, our refined low-fidelity wireframes looked like the following:</p>

        <h3>Refined Community Page Flow</h3>

        </div>

        <hr class="horizontal-line">
        <h1>Part 6: High-Fidelity Prototyping</h1>
        <p>After updating our low-fidelity wireframes, we were ready to move onto creating the high-fidelity prototypes. However, before doing so, we created a visual design style guide inspired by the rough style guide/brand kit provided by Warp. This allowed
            our group to understand the visual language intended by the client as well as create coherent designs.</p>

        <h3>High-Fidelity Prototype for Community Page Flow</h3>

        <h1>Final Founder Feedback and Conclusion:</h1>
        <p>In the end, we presented our final high-fidelity prototypes to our designer and received positive feedback. It was a great experience to engage with the full iterative design process with a unique company that presented an interesting challenge
            for us. This project also gave us a good opportunity to practice building collaborative designs with a team that mirror cross-functional teams in industry.</p>
