        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>For this project, we worked in a group of 4 to brainstorm, design, and construct an interactive prototype for Warp, a terminal reimagined with Ai and collaborative tools for better productivity. This project was divided into 7 distinct phases:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Identifying and understanding the problem at hand</li>
            <li>Sketching preliminary ideas individually about a potential solution</li>
            <li>Finalizing a low-fidelity wireframe</li>
            <li>Participating in a peer critique and revising the prototype based on feedback received</li>
            <li>Creating and refining a style guide</li>
            <li>Developing a final, clickable, high-fidelity prototype</li>
            <li>Presenting the final prototype to the client and receiving feedback</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Part 1: Understanding and Clarifying the Problem</h1>
        <p>For this project, the main problem that we needed to address was that in Warp today, there is no place in the product to connect with other users, share tools, or install extensions. The two main target groups that are affected by this problem
            are the <b>creator</b>, who falls under the persona of an experienced developer that enjoys making and sharing tools for others to use, and the <b>consumer</b>, who is looking for a tool to help get a particular task done. Our hope is to introduce
            several features that allow users to find tools without having to leave the interface as well as grow their career/personal brands and learn more about particular tools or methodologies.</p>

        <h1>Part 2: Sketching</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In this phase, each member of our group created 2 different end-to-end flows for solving our startup's problem.</p>

        <h1>Part 3: First Iteration (Low-Fidelity) Wireframing</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>For the low-fidelity wireframing phase, our group convened to discuss which parts of the sketches best address different needs of the client. We eventually came to an agreement on 3 main features: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>A new community page</li>
            <li>Enhanced user profiles</li>
            <li>Ability to publish a tool from the existing Warp Drive</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Below, we have displayed the low-fidelity wireframes for each of these 3 main flows:</p>

        <h3>Community Page Flow</h3>

        <h3>Publishing a Tool Flow</h3>

        <h1>Part 4: Studio Critique and Mid-Project Check In</h1>
        <p>After presenting our low-fidelity wireframes to the client and receiving feedback from both them and our classmates in studio, we decide to make the following changes to our wireframes. Firstly, we wanted to incorporate the same profile view that
            is visible from opening Warp Drive into the community page. Another piece of feedback that we received was to add options for a user to install, uninstall, and rate a tool. Lastly, the client provided shared that a side-by-side vertical view
            for the community page would be more intuitive and user-friendly. After implementing those changes, our refined low-fidelity wireframes looked like the following: </p>
